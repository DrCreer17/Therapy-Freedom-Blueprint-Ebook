## CHAPTER 1: THE CLINIC BURNOUT CRISIS

Are you tired of...

- Working 50+ hours per week for someone else's dream?
- Seeing 12-15 patients daily with no time for quality care?
- Missing family events because of weekend documentation?
- Making $65-75K while generating $300K+ in revenue for your employer?
- Feeling like just another cog in the healthcare machine?

You're not alone. Recent studies show that **73% of therapists have considered leaving the profession due to burnout, low pay, and poor work-life balance.**

#### THE TRADITIONAL CLINIC MODEL IS BROKEN:

- ❌ High patient volumes = rushed treatments
- ❌ Excessive documentation requirements
- ❌ Limited earning potential as an employee
- ❌ No control over your schedule or patient load
- ❌ Constant pressure to see more patients faster

But what if there was a better way?
